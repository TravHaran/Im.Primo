# Im.Primo: Wireless 3D Scanning & 3D Printing at your fingertips

Im.Primo allows users to scan objects with their phone and 3D Print it with the click of a button. The application leverages the Lidar scanner in an iPhone coupled with SLAM algorithms to scan an object and grenerate a mesh file. This mesh file is then sent to a backend server which filters it and converts it into a 3D Printable STL file. This STL file is then sent to a 3D printer running Octoprint on a Raspberry Pi to enable wireless printing.


Built using Python, Swift, Django, StandardCyborg API, & OctoPrint API
